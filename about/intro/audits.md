# Audits

QOM ONE is connecting two major worlds in the crypto universe by enabling compatibility between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. This does not come without its difficulties, and security always is a top priority for the Qom One developers.

Each feature is extensively tested and internally audited by the team before being brought to the users. However, external audits are a valuable and necessary assurance for the security of the protocol itself and with that, also for anyone deploying on or using Qom One.

## Publicly Available Audits

This page lists the publicly available audits, that have been conducted on the Qom One and Ethermint codebases:
